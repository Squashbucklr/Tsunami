At first look, this program may seem strikingly similar to other file uploaders. What sets us apart from our competition, however, is that by using our program, anyone is able to upload and transfer a media file of any size to someone else. Additionally, the speed at which files are uploaded matches, or is even faster than those of other competitors, such as Dropbox or Mediafire. As for the future, if possible, we would like to add some security measures to prevent possible theft help keep those who use our program safe. Currently, what we have created is an open server where anyone can upload, download, or delete a media file. We plan to make this more secure and private by having a transfer service where one can send an file directly to the intended target, so that someone does not accidentally delete or receive the wrong file. To achieve this goal, we intend to include a login system where one can find their intended recipient without too much hassle. As a final product, we intend for our program to be easily accessible to all, convenient to use, and well-known.z
