# BaristaBot

*What is it?*

BaristaBot is the bot for The Coffee Nexus, a Discord server with the goal of playing Overwatch, making teams, and playing with new people. You can join it [heree](http://discord.gg/wAAFk5T). 

*What does it do?*

BaristaBot is used on our server for scheduling and stats.

*What does scheduling do?*

Scheduling can schedule an event such as a scrim or a game between two teams to happen at a certian time. You can find help for the schedule command by typing `!sched halp` in a channel the bot can read or a DM with the bot.

*What does stats do?*

Stats is how we keep track of playwers SR in Overwatch. Its primary function is to post the players SR and Main Heroes in the [#stat-info](https://discordapp.com/channels/279297223660011520/293052830057627649) chat, but there are commands needed to interact with it. You can find help for the stats command by typing `!stats halp` in a channel the bot can read or a DM with the bot.

*that seems cool, and I want to use it in my server!*

Cool! you can clone the bot and use it! however there is some config and there are zero promises as to how the bot will work. Here is how you config the bot:
* Create the file config.js
  * clone the file from config-temp.js
  * replace the strings with the IDs of your guild and channels, and the login token for your bot. (google how to get the IDs if you don't know)
* install the required node packages.
  * discord.js
  * node-schedule
  * overwatch-js
  * node-libcurl
  * node-localstorage

Again, the bot tends to be a tad buggy, so use at your own risk!

*Cool!*
